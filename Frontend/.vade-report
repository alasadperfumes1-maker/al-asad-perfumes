## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for this Next.js 16.1.6 application with App Router.

### Changes Made:

**1. Package Installation:**
   - Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using npm
   - Updated package.json to include the new dependency
   - Updated package-lock.json with the new package and its 49 dependencies

**2. Root Layout Update (src/app/layout.js):**
   - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
   - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after existing components (Analytics, Footer, WhatsAppButton)
   - Positioned it after the existing `<Analytics />` component to maintain consistent monitoring setup

### Implementation Details:

Since this project uses Next.js 16.1.6 with the App Router (which is well above the 13.5+ version requirement), I used the recommended approach:
- Import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Simple component placement without requiring `usePathname()` or client component directives
- The component is self-contained and will automatically track page navigation performance

### Verification:

✅ Build completed successfully - all static pages generated without errors
✅ No TypeScript/linting errors introduced
✅ All dependencies properly installed and lock files updated
✅ Integration follows Next.js App Router best practices

### Files Modified:

1. `Frontend/package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
2. `Frontend/package-lock.json` - Updated with new package and dependencies
3. `Frontend/src/app/layout.js` - Added SpeedInsights import and component

The Speed Insights component is now active and will collect real user performance metrics when the application is deployed to Vercel.
