# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (version ^1.6.1) using npm
- Updated `package.json` to include the new dependency
- Updated `package-lock.json` with resolved dependencies

### 2. Modified Files
- **Frontend/src/app/layout.js**
  - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the Footer component
  - Preserved all existing code structure and styling

### 3. Implementation Details
This project uses the App Router pattern (Next.js 16.1.6), so the Analytics component was added to the root layout file at `Frontend/src/app/layout.js`. The component is placed at the end of the body tag to ensure it doesn't interfere with the application's rendering or user experience.

### 4. Verification Steps Completed
- ✅ Package installed successfully (npm install @vercel/analytics)
- ✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors (verified during build)
- ✅ All static pages generated correctly
- ✅ Lock files updated appropriately

## How It Works
The `<Analytics />` component from `@vercel/analytics/next` will automatically:
- Track page views
- Collect Web Vitals data
- Send analytics data to Vercel when the application is deployed
- Work seamlessly in both development and production environments

## Next Steps
Once deployed to Vercel, analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab for this project.
